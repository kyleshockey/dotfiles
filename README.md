### Bash
##### New commands
- `f`: opens the current directory in Finder
- `c`: clears the Terminal window
- `dir`: alias for ls (couldn't get out of the habit)
- `rmi`: interactive rm
- `..`, `...`, `.[3,4,5,6]`: extensions of cd, goes up 1-6 levels

##### Changed commands
- `ls` becomes `ls -G`: adds color to ls
- `mkdir` becomes `mkdir -pv`: mkdir will create intermediate directories if necessary, and list folders as they're created
- `rm` becomes `rm --preserve-root`: makes rm a little less dangerous
